## The Project Goals

    3. Create an issue template for the new repository similar to the labs.  
      
    4. Create issues for the stakeholder requirements listed above (10 in total). Fill in the As a… I need… So that… section of the template.  
      
    5. Move requirements 7 and 8 issues into the Icebox.
      
    6. Move the remaining issues into the Product Backlog.  
      
    7. Conduct a Backlog Refinement meeting and rank the Product Backlog to match the requirements order.  
      
    8. Update the top 5 stories in the Product Backlog with acceptance criteria following the Gherkin Given… When… Then… syntax.

    12. Conduct a Sprint Planning meeting. Add the top 4 stories to the sprint, assign them to the sprint milestone, and assign story point estimates.  
    Move these 4 stories to the Sprint Backlog.  
      
    13. Simulate a sprint by assigning the top story to yourself. Move it to the In Progress column.
